ChangeLog
=========

* Fix download indicator for compatibility with Docker 0.7.x
* Renamed 'status' command to 'fullstatus', and implemented new, faster
  'status' command that only looks at the state of the containers, not
  the services themselves
* Sort containers before building dependencies to try to keep them a bit
  more organized without breaking the dependency order
* Don't use white in commands output, just bold text
* Compatibility fixes with docker-py 0.2.3
* The 'logs' command now streams logs instead of dumping them, until you
  hit ^C to stop
* Implement registry login before pull, when needed and if possible
* Renamed 'scores' to 'plays', makes more sense
* Updates to the 'logs' command:
  - by default, the 'logs' command now dumps the full log and doesn't
    stream/follow
  - with the '-F' flag, logs will be followed
  - the new '-n N' flag will only show the last N lines of the log, but
    it doesn't work with streaming logs
* Setup for Travis-CI build with flake8 validation
