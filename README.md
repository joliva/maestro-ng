MaestroNG, an orchestrator of Docker-based deployments
======================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/signalfuse/maestro-ng.png)](https://travis-ci.org/signalfuse/maestro-ng)

The original [Maestro](http://github.com/toscanini/maestro) was developed
as a single-host orchestrator for Docker-based deployments. Given the
state of Docker at the time of its writing, it was a great first step
towards orchestration of deployments using Docker containers as the unit
of application distribution.

Docker having made significant advancements since then, deployments and
environments spanning across several hosts are becoming more and more
common and are in the need for some orchestration.

Based off ideas from the original Maestro and taking inspiration from
Docker's _links_ feature, MaestroNG makes the deployment and control of
complex, multi-host environments using Docker containers possible and
easy to use. Maestro of course supports declared dependencies between
services and makes sure to honor those during environment bring up.

**[See a demo](http://showterm.io/c275984679f8f148b6403)**

What is Maestro?
----------------

MaestroNG is, for now, a command-line utility that allows for
automatically managing the orchestrated deployment and bring up of a set
of service instance containers that compose an environment on a set of
target host machines.

Each host machine is expected to run a Docker daemon. Maestro will then
contact the Docker daemon of each host in the environment to figure out
the status of the environment and what actions to take based on the
requested command.

Dependencies
------------

MaestroNG requires Docker 0.6.7 or newer on the hosts as it makes use of
the container naming feature and bug fixes in NAT port forwarding.

You'll also need the following Python modules, although these will be
automatically installed by `setuptools` if you follow the instructions
below.

* PyYAML (you may need to install this manually, e.g. `apt-get install python-yaml`)
* A recent [docker-py](http://github.com/dotcloud/docker-py)

Installation
------------

You can install Maestro via _Pip_:

```
$ pip install --user --upgrade git+git://github.com/signalfuse/maestro-ng
```

Orchestration
=============

The orchestration features of Maestro obviously rely on the
collaboration of the Docker containers that you are controlling with
Maestro. Maestro basically takes care of two things:

1. Controlling the start (and stop) order of services during environment
   bring up and tear down according to the defined dependencies between
   services.
1. Passing extra environment variables to each container to pass all the
   information it may need to operate in that environment, in particular
   information about its dependencies.

Let's first look at how environments and services are described, then
we'll discuss what information Maestro passes down to the containers
through their environment.

Environment description
-----------------------

The environment is described using YAML. The format is still a bit in
flux but the base has been set and should remain fairly stable. It is
named and composed of three main sections: the _registries_ that define
authentication credentials that might be needed to pull the Docker
images for the defined _services_ from their registries, the _ships_,
hosts that will execute the Docker containers, and the _services_, which
define what service make up the environment, the dependencies between
these services and the instances of each of these services that need to
run. Here's the outline:

```yaml
name: demo
registries:
  # Auth credentials for each registry that needs them (see below)
ships:
  # Ships definitions (see below)
services:
  # Services definition (see below)
```

The _registries_ define for each Docker registry Maestro might need to
pull images from the authentication credentials needed to access them
(see below _Working with image registries_). For each registry, the full
registry URL, a `username` and a `password` are required, and depending
on the registry the `email` might be as well. For example:

```yaml
registries:
  my-private-registry:
    registry: https://my-private-registry/v1/
    username: maestro
    password: secret
    email: maestro-robot@domain.com
```

The _ships_ are simple to define. They are named (but that name doesn't
need to match their DNS resolvable host name), and need an `ip`
address/hostname. If the Docker daemon doesn't listen its default port
of 4243, the `docker_port` can be overriden:

```yaml
ships:
  vm1.ore1:   {ip: c414.ore1.domain.com}
  vm2.ore2:   {ip: c415.ore1.domain.com, docker_port: 4244}
  controller: {ip: 42.42.42.1}
```

Services are also named. Their name is used for commands that act on
specific services instead of the whole environment, and is also used in
dependency declarations. Each service must define the Docker image its
instances will be using, and of course a description of each instance.
It can also define environment variables that will apply to all
of that service's instances.

Each service instance must at least define the _ship_ its container will
be placed on (by name). Additionally, it may define:

  - port mappings, as a map of `<port name>: <port or port mapping
    spec>` (see below for port spec syntax);
  - volume mappings, as a map of `<destination in container>: <source from host>`;
  - environment variables, as a map of `<variable name>: <value>`.
  - whether the container should run in privileged mode, as a boolean
  `privileged: true | false` (Defaults to false).

```yaml
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: zookeeper:3.4.5
    instances:
      zk-1:
        ship: vm1.ore1
        ports: {client: 2181, peer: 2888, leader_election: 3888}
        privileged: true
        volumes:
          /var/lib/zookeeper: /data/zookeeper
      zk-2:
        ship: vm2.ore1
        ports: {client: 2181, peer: 2888, leader_election: 3888}
        volumes:
          /var/lib/zookeeper: /data/zookeeper
  kafka:
    image: kafka:latest
    requires: [ zookeeper ]
    instances:
      kafka-broker:
        ship: vm2.ore1
        ports: {broker: 9092}
        volumes:
          /var/lib/kafka: /data/kafka
        env:
          BROKER_ID: 0
```

Port mapping syntax
-------------------

Maestro supports several syntaxes for specifying port mappings. Unless
the syntax supports and/or specifies it, Maestro will make the following
assumptions:

 * the exposed and external ports are the same (_exposed_ means the port
   bound to inside the container, _external_ means the port mapped by
   Docker on the host to the port inside the container);
 * the protocol is TCP (`/tcp`);
 * the external port is bound on all host interfaces using the `0.0.0.0`
   address.

The simplest form is a single numeric value, which maps the given TCP
port from the container to all interfaces of the host on that same port:

```yaml
# 25/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:25/tcp
ports: {smtp: 25}
```

If you want UDP, you can specify so:

```yaml
# 53/udp -> 0.0.0.0:53/udp
ports: {dns: 53/udp}
```

If you want a different external port, you can specify a mapping by
separating the two port numbers by a colon:

```yaml
# 25/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:2525/tcp
ports: {smtp: "25:2525"}
```

Similarly, specifying the protocol (they should match!):

```yaml
# 53/udp -> 0.0.0.0:5353/udp
ports: {dns: "53/udp:5353/udp"}
```

You can also use the dictionary form for any of these:

```yaml
ports:
  # 25/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:25/tcp
  smtp:
    exposed: 25
    external: 25

  # 53/udp -> 0.0.0.0:5353/udp
  dns:
    exposed: 53/udp
    external: 5353/udp
```

If you need to bind to a specific interface or IP address on the host,
you need to use the dictionary form:

```yaml
# 25/tcp -> 192.168.10.2:25/tcp
ports:
  smtp:
    exposed: 25
    external: [ 192.168.10.2, 25 ]


  # 53/udp -> 192.168.10.2:5353/udp
  dns:
    exposed: 53/udp
    external: [ 192.168.10.2, 5353/udp ]
```

Note that YAML supports references, which means you don't have to repeat
your _ship_'s IP address if you do something like this:

```yaml
ship:
  demo: {ip: &demoip 192.168.10.2, docker_port: 4243}

services:
  ...
    ports:
      smtp:
        exposed: 25/tcp
        external: [ *demoip, 25/tcp ]
```

Port mappings and named ports
-----------------------------

When services depend on each other, they most likely need to
communicate. If service B depends on service A, service B needs to be
configured with information on how to reach service A (its host and
port).

Even though Docker can provide inter-container networking, in a
multi-host environment this is not possible. Maestro also needs to keep
in mind that not all hosting and cloud providers provide advanced
networking features like multicast or bridged frames. This is why
Maestro makes the choice of always using the host's external IP address
and relies on traditional layer 3 communication between containers.

There is no performance hit from this, even when two containers on the
same host communicate, and it enables inter-host communication in a more
generic way regardless of where the two containers are located. Of
course, it is up to you to make sure that the hosts in your environment
can communicate with each other.

Note that even though Maestro allows for fully customizable port
mappings from the container to the host (see Port mapping syntax) above,
it is usually recommended to use the same port number inside and outside
the container. It makes it slightly easier for troubleshooting and some
services (Cassandra is one example) assume that all their nodes use the
same port(s), so the port they know about inside the container may need
to be the external port they use to connect to one of their peers.

One of the downsides of this approach is that if you run multiple
instances of the same service on the same host, you need to manually
make sure they don't use the same ports, through their configuration,
when that's possible.

Finally, Maestro uses _named_ ports, where each port your configure for
each service instance is named. This name is the name used by the
instance container to find out how it should be configured and on which
port(s) it needs to listen, but it's also the name used for each port
exposed through environment variables to other containers. This way, a
dependent service can know the address of a remote service, and the
specific port number of a desired endpoint. For example, service
depending on ZooKeeper would be looking for its `client` port.

How Maestro orchestrates and service auto-configuration
-------------------------------------------------------

The orchestration performed by Maestro is two-fold. The first part is
providing a way for each container to learn about the environment they
evolve into, to discover about their peers and/or the container
instances of other services in their environment. The second part is by
controlling the start/stop sequence of services and their containers,
taking service dependencies into account.

With inspiration from Docker's _links_ feature, Maestro utilizes
environment variables to pass information down to each container. Each
container is guaranteed to get the following environment variables:

* `SERVICE_NAME`: the friendly name of the service the container is an
  instance of. Note that it is possible to have multiple clusters of the
  same kind of application by giving them distinct friendly names.
* `CONTAINER_NAME`: the friendly name of the instance, which is also
  used as the name of the container itself. This will also be the
  visible hostname from inside the container.
* `CONTAINER_HOST_ADDRESS`: the external IP address of the host of the
  container. This can be used as the "advertised" address when services
  use dynamic service discovery techniques.

Then, for each container of each service that the container depends on,
a set of environment variables is added:

* `<SERVICE_NAME>_<CONTAINER_NAME>_HOST`: the external IP address of the
  host of the container, which is the address the application inside the
  container can be reached with accross the network.
* For each port declared by the dependent container:
  - `<SERVICE_NAME>_<CONTAINER_NAME>_<PORT_NAME>_PORT`, containing the
    external, addressable port number.

Each container of a service also gets these two variables for each
instance of that service so it knows about its peers. It also gets the
following variable for each port defined:

* `<SERVICE_NAME>_<CONTAINER_NAME>_<PORT_NAME>_INTERNAL_PORT`,
  containing the exposed (internal) port number that is, most likely,
  only reachable from inside the container and usually the port the
  application running in the container wants to bind to.

With all this information available in the container's environment, each
container can then easily know about its surroundings and the other
services it might need to talk to. It then becomes really easy to bridge
the gap between the information Maestro provides to the container via
its environment and the application you want to run inside the
container.

You could, of course, have your application directly read the
environment variables pushed in by Maestro. But that would tie your
application logic to Maestro, a specific orchestration system; you do
not want that. Instead, you can write a _startup script_ that will
inspect the environment and generate a configuration file for your
application (or pass in command-line flags).

To make this easier, Maestro provides a set of helper functions
available in its `maestro.guestutils` module. The recommended (or
easiest) way to build this startup script is to write it in Python, and
have the Maestro package installed in your container.

Guest utils helper functions
----------------------------

To make use of the Maestro guest utils functions, you'll need to have
the Maestro package installed inside your container. You can easily
achieve this by adding the following to your Dockerfile (select the
version of Maestro that you need):

```
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install python python-pip git
RUN pip install git+git://github.com/signalfuse/maestro-ng
```

This will install the latest available version of Maestro. Feel free to
change that to any other version of Maestro you like or need.

Then, from your startup script (in Python), do:

```
from maestro.guestutils import *
```

And you're ready to go. Here's a summary of the functions available at
your disposal that will make your life much easier:

  - `get_environment_name()` returns the name of the environment as
    defined in the description file. Could be useful to namespace
    information inside ZooKeeper for example.
  - `get_service_name()` returns the friendly name of the service the
    container is a member of.
  - `get_container_name()` returns the friendly name of the container
    itself.
  - `get_container_host_address()` returns the IP address or hostname of
    the host of the container. Useful if your application needs to
    advertise itself to some service discovery system.
  - `get_container_internal_address()` returns the IP address assigned
    to the container itself by Docker (its private IP address).
  - `get_port(name, default)` will return the exposed (internal) port
    number of a given named port for the current container instance.
    This is useful to set configuration parameters for example.

Another very useful function is the `get_node_list` function. It takes
in a service name and an optional list of port names and returns the
list of IP addresses/hostname of the containers of that service. For
each port specified, in order, it will append `:<port number>` to each
host with the external port number. For example, if you want to return
the list of ZooKeeper endpoints with their client ports:

```python
get_node_list('zookeeper', ports=['client']) -> ['c414.ore1.domain.com:2181', 'c415.ore1.domain.com:2181']
```

Other functions you might need are:

  - `get_specific_host(service, container)`, which can be used to return
    the hostname or IP address of a specific container from a given
    service, and
  - `get_specific_port(service, container, port, default)`, to retrieve
    the external port number of a specific named port of a given
    container.
  - `get_specific_exposed_port(service, container, port, default)`, to
    retrieve the exposed (internal) port number of a specific named port
    of a given container.

Working with image registries
-----------------------------

When Maestro needs to start a new container, it will do whatever it can
to make sure the image this container needs is available; the image full
name is specified at the service level.

Maestro will first check if the target Docker daemon reports the image
to be available. If the image is not available, or if the `-r` flag was
passed on the command-line (to force refresh the images), Maestro will
attempt to pull the image.

To do so, it will first analyze the name of the image and try to
identify a registry name (for example
`my-private-registry/my-image:tag`, the address of the registry is
`my-private-registry`) and look for a corresponding entry in the
`registries` section of the environment description file to look for
authentication credentials, if they are needed to access the images from
that registry.

If credentials are found, Maestro will login to the registry before
attempting to pull the image.

Passing extra environment variables
-----------------------------------

You can pass in or override arbitrary environment variables by providing
a dictionary of environment variables key/value pairs. This can be done
both at the service level and the container level; the latter taking
precedence:

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    image: ...
    env:
      FOO: bar
    instance-1:
      ship: host
      env:
        FOO: overrides bar
        FOO_2: bar2
```

Additionally, Maestro will automatically expand all levels of YAML lists
in environment variable values. The following are equivalent:

```yaml
env:
  FOO: This is a test
  BAR: [ This, [ is, a ], test ]
```

This becomes useful when used in conjunction with YAML references to
build more complex environment variable values:

```yaml
_globals:
  DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS: &jvmopts [ '-Xms500m', '-Xmx2g', '-showversion', '-server' ]

...

env:
  JVM_OPTS: [ *jvmopts, '-XX:+UseConcMarkSweep' ]
```

Usage
=====

Once installed, Maestro is available both as a library through the
`maestro` package and as an executable. Note that if you didn't install
Maestro system-wide, you can still run it with the same commands as long
as your `PYTHONPATH` contains the path to your `maestro-ng` repository
clone. To run Maestro, simply execute the main Python package:

```
$ python -m maestro -h
usage: maestro [-h] [-f [FILE]] [-c CMD] [-r] [-F] [-n LINES] [-o]
               [{status,fullstatus,start,stop,clean,logs}] [thing [thing ...]]

Docker container orchestrator.

positional arguments:
  {status,fullstatus,start,stop,clean,logs}
                        orchestration command to execute
  thing                 container(s) or service(s) to act on

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f [FILE], --file [FILE]
                        read environment description from FILE (use - for
                        stdin)
  -c CMD, --completion CMD
                        list commands, services or containers in environment
                        based on CMD
  -r, --refresh-images  force refresh of container images from registry
  -F, --follow          follow logs as they are generated
  -n LINES              Only show the last LINES lines for logs
  -o, --only            only affect the selected container or service
```

By default, Maestro will read the environment description from the
standard input so if you run Maestro without arguments it will appear to
not do anything and just be "stuck". You can also use the `-f` flag to
specify the path to the environment file. The two following commands are
identical:

```
$ python -m maestro < demo.yaml
$ python -m maestro -f demo.yaml
```

The first positional argument is a command you want Maestro to execute.
The available commands are `status`, `fullstatus`, `start`, `stop` and
`logs`. They should all be self-explanatory. Service dependency is
always honored for all commands. Note that if services don't have any
dependencies (or have the same dependencies), their start order might
not always be the same.

You can also pass one or more service names or container names on which
to execute the command, to restrict the action of the command to just
these services or containers (or any combination of both).  Note that
Maestro will do its best to examine the state of the system and not
perform any action unless it's really necessary.

You can force Maestro to operate only on the containers and services
that were explicitely given on the command-line by using the `-o` flag.

Finally, if started without any arguments, default to the `status`
command on all containers, thus showing the state of the environment.

Examples of Docker images with Maestro orchestration
====================================================

For examples of Docker images that are suitable for use with Maestro,
you can look at the following repositories:

- http://github.com/signalfuse/docker-cassandra  
  A Cassandra image. Nodes within the same cluster are automatically
  used as Gossip seed peers.

- http://github.com/signalfuse/docker-elasticsearch  
  ElasicSearch with ZooKeeper-based discovery instead of the
  multicast-based discovery, to work in cloud environments.

- http://github.com/signalfuse/docker-zookeeper  
  A ZooKeeper image, automatically creating a cluster with the other
  instances in the same environment.
